# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm **Not The Real 1ne**  

ðŸŽ® **Game Developer** | â˜• **Java Programmer** | ðŸ’» Web Developer

I am an intermediate developer. My work spans game development, messing around with code, and whatever else makes me happy.
While many of my projects are small in scope or works in progress, each one helped me learn something new.  

## ðŸš€ Professional Goals  

I am aiming to become a professional developer. 
My aim is to consistently challenge myself with new projects and gain the experience needed to take my work to the next level.
